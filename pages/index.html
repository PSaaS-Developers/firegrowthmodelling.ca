            <h1>Welcome to FireGrowthModel.ca</h1>

            <p>FireGrowthModel.ca is home to Prometheus: the Canadian Wildland Fire Growth Simulation Model, and other
                fire models that utilize the Prometheus COM. Prometheus is the result of a national project endorsed by
                the <a href="http://www.ciffc.ca" target="new">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</a> and its
                members.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.alberta.ca/agriculture-and-forestry.aspx" target="new">Alberta Agriculture and
                    Forestry</a> is now the lead agency and custodian of Prometheus. The <a
                    href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests" target="new">Canadian Forest Service</a> maintains Burn-P3 and
                Pandora in collaboration with forest and fire management agencies across Canada.</p>

            <p>Considerable time and effort are spent to ensure these software applications can be used by fire
                management agencies across Canada and other interested stakeholders including natural resource managers,
                planners, and researchers. The lead agencies have also extended support to fire management agencies and
                researchers outside of Canada.</p>
